### Basics
1. Loop Closure
	- Robot revists an already seen location
2. Odometry Measurements 
	- Descries the motion of the robot
3. Underlying Pose-Graph and Pose-Graph Optimizaiton
	- 


### Types of SLAM
Lidar Slam
	- Point clouds offer higher observability = reduces chances of false loop closures
	- Loop closures are computed by estimating the transform between two point clouds
		- Expensive process, can't be used for every candidate esp. for MRS

EKF-based SLAM
	- computational complexity is porpotional to N^2 , where N is the number of mapped features.
	- Used in
		- [[202106291824]] Davison Simultaneous localization and map-building using Active Vision


Visual SLAM
Active SLAM
	- Actively seeking out candidates for loop clsure

Semantic SLAM
	- Generates a map that Is also labeled in some way
	- Combined with a geometric map Deng20 in Zotero
	- Requires parsing of the semantic images which can be done using a neural network. The output looks like a flood filled version of the image where the different colors are different identified regions.

### Ways to Generate Loop Closures
1. Place recognition
2. Junction detection
3. Promixity based generation
