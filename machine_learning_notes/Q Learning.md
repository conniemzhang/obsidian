Greedy in the Limit of Infinite Exploration (GLIE)
- Behavior policy (policy used to act in the world) converges to greedy policy.\A simple GLIE strategy is $\epsilon$-
- Theorem: GLIE Monte-Carlo control converges to the optimal state-action value fucntion 
- One of the reasons why you think about e-greedy algorithms because you get an optimal function while acting in the world.
