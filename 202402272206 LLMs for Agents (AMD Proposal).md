#LLM 

What if you could read in world specifications or sensor data into the LLM and interpret that? 
Sensor data would be for things like dynamic objects. 
Using LLMs to do error handling. 
What about LLMS to generate animations? 

**Ideas**
Note: I really want LLMs to summarize research papers
Automatic graph generation? ehhh 
Generative AI DJ for wedding events and planning. 
Something to make posting on social media easier? 
Something in the 3D modeling space? 
Navigating complex things like tax forms or lawyers. 

**What problem are you going to solve?**
We will make it easier to handle faults for deployed robotic agents in the real world. 
i want the robot to tell me what is wrong. 
Trouble shoot for you based on input from the robot. 

Make it easier to debug robot failures in the real world through LLMs with RAG. Improved customer support by troubleshooting technical data. 
- would need a database of previous failures and resolutions 
	- Really running up against the data problem in ML
- How would you sterilize data that may have complex origins into cause and effect? I guess you just throw it into the LLM and it finds the patterns. 
  

The use of LLMs for robotic task planning has been booming, but little has been done to handle practical use cases. We are interested in implementing 

I work professional
LLM as the intermediary translation layer between the user and the robot. 


Generative AI for Human-Robot Teaming
I wish to fine tune the ability to give a robot instructions and still output enactable robot actions. This should include limitations on what instructions it can or can not execute for safety reasons. 

**How does your solution work? What are the main features? Please specify how you will use the AMD AI Hardware in your solution.**

Our solution requires fine-tuning an existing LLM to 
  
Accessing a database of customer resolutions.f 

**List the hardware and software you will use to build this.**

Gazebo for world simulation.
ROS2 for agent communication.
