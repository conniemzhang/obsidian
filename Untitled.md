Chewy Autonomy Mobile Picking Solution
  
Collaboration, autonomy, reinforcement, learning, and integration.
Works in an area where humans are also working to remove shrink wrap, etc.

we are looking for something that will be fully autonomous using AI for perception, control, object recognition, manipulation, and something that can deploy at a large scale with minimal operator oversight.

Now that doesn't mean it needs to be fully autonomous on day one.

I've talked with many robotics companies that have sort of a path to full autonomy where initial deployments start with little or semi-autonomous solutions, and then over time evolve and add on layers of autonomy.

We're completely open to that, but we do expect the final solution to be fully autonomous.

Reinforcement learning for improvement on performance.

NVIDIA Omniverse for robotic development, testing, training, simulation

They've created a digital twin for the process they are looking to automate.

### Process Flow
So a box will travel down a main conveyor line and then differ into a zone, and there's a pick point in the zone where the box will stop.

Each box has a scannable barcode, which contains the order information from our warehouse management system.

And so the process flow that we envision for this is the box arrives at a pack location.

The robot solution obtains the PIC instructions either by scanning the barcode or through some integration we do with our warehouse management system.

We're intentionally leaving that open-ended.

Robot would travel to the target PIC pallet.

The robot would pick one item from the top of the pallet, travel back to the pack location, place the picked item into the box, confirm that the pick is complete, either with a scan or with integrated communication with our WMS, and then the box would leave the pack station.

Right now, this process is done entirely by a human operator with a radio frequency scanner.

And so they would scan the label, go travel to the pallet, pick the item, put it in the box, scan the item, scan the box, and then push the box back onto the conveyor.

And so, we're looking for a solution that has minimal, minimal infrastructure changes required to how the area is set up for our human operators today.


And you can see the main travel area 36 inches and then the aisles for which the robot will have to navigate up to to reach the pallets in the back are 20 inches wide.

 Obviously, this is going to be a complicated project, and there's a lot of things that are going to come into consideration, but these are four that really come into my top of mind for me, innovation, experimentation, collaboration, and scalability.

So we're looking for a partner that is interested in co-developing and growing with us, not just selling us something off a shelf.
