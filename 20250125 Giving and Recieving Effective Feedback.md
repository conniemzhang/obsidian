### how to seek effective feedback
1. Ask the right people - not everyone will tell you the truch
	* Unloving Critics: hate everything you do
	* Uncritical lovers: love everything you do
	* Loving critics: have your best interest at heart and will tell you the trush
2. Ask the right quetions - be very clear on what feedback you want.
	* Be specific about what you'd like feedback on
	* Ex: "I've been told my assertiveness in meetings comes across as rude, Is this in line iwth your experiences with me/ Why or why not"
3. Follow the right prcess
	- Tell potential feedback givers what you're doing and why
	- Give them time to respond
	- Set regular meetings to discuss
	- Allow yourself time ot integrate learnings into your working style.
