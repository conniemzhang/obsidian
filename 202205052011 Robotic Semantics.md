Crespo20 Semantic Information for Robot Navigation A Survey

**Semantic Navigation**
	- applies to both arms and mobile
	- Often uses ontologies because physical spaces have a hierarchy
	- Integrates high-level concepts from the environment in a navigation stack. 
		- also exploits relationships as certain spaces may be more likely to have certain objects.
	- **Inference** is the name of the game

**Acquiring information can be done either by a human providing information, or autonomously done through the following:**
	1. Laser sensors that acquire high level information
		- Augmented topological map with semantic information through linkage (anchoring) Galindo
	2. Classification and clustering and labeling of maps
		- Spectral clustering and random fields of Voronoi to generate two-dimensional topological maps
		-
	3. Object recognition and place labeling using visual cues. 
		- Predicting a semantic category based on identified objects
		- Depth helps with this, RGB-D
