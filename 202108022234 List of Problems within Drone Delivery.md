# List of Problems within Drone Delivery
tags = #DroneDelivery

Problems


1. Scheduling (Logistics?)
	* Given constraints (population density, [b]energy[/b], communication)
	* Path-planning routes with different delivery times.
2. Safety
	* 
3. Path-planning and Vehicle Routing
	* non-time depedent paths through populated areas, or airspaces.
	* 
4. Real-World Deloyment Problems


Priorities
1. Safety
2. Reliability in terms of delivery guarantees, drone availability



Constraints
1. Battery
	Limited battery life means limited missions.
2. Weight
	A drone can only carry about five-seven pounds at a time. How to incorporate multiple drones into one delivery. 
3. Expense
	How do you minimize the least number of drones needed to cover an area. Do you allow the drones to migrate from one facility to another.
4. Safety
	Last-mile logistics of landing and finding a safe place to land.
