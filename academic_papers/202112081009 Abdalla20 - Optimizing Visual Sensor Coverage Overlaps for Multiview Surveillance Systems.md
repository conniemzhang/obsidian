#Paper #Camera-Placement #Surveillance

### Summary
* 

### Main Idea
* Uses a "annual sector" representation of security cameras in 3D to monitor and envrionment in 2D. 

* Apart from the primary coverage, less attention is given in the literature to the overlapping optimization. The overlapping cost is usually realized by the visual sensor coverage intersection in deterministic modeling environment [14], [15], [19], [26]

### Method 
*

* Following the sensor coverage definition, the placement problem is usually formulated in a digitized space with the aim of maximizing the coverage while maintaining quality measures [18], [19], [34]–[39]
