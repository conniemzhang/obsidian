### Path-Choosing SLAM
If you are able to path plan in such a way that you can dynamically choose which area to cover with which robot, mapping could be done much more efficiently. 

Can either be done with LiDAR or purely computer vision.

May require that you have perfect localization, which may not make it SLAM.

Machine learning for identifying stuff with weird stitched image shapes
Or in general semantic labelling for last mile drone delivery.
