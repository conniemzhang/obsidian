## Huitaloche
Last year, huitlacoche arrived spontaneously in my garden, growing on the tassels of my corn.

This year, I grew it on purpose. Here's what I did:

I took a tissue sample from the fresh galls, and propagated it on a few generations of agar until I had an axenic culture (no contaminants or other microbes growing, just U. maydis).

I transferred a wedge of the agar into a sterilized jar of 4% dextrose solution to grow some liquid culture. I stirred and agitated the jar a few times a day to keep it oxygenated. It's helpful to put a magnetic stir bar or a couple of marbles in the jar before sterilizing to aid in mixing.

When the corn was starting to produce cobs, and baby silks were just beginning to emerge from the tops of the ears, I used a syringe to transfer LC out of the jar (I use modified lids that have both a silicone injection port and a Tyvek patch for gas exchange). I then squirted a few cc of culture down each developing ear of corn.

A few weeks later I harvested some cobs, and hey presto: more huitlacoche.

Oh, and I ate mine in quesadillas - just a quick pan fry before adding to the filling.
