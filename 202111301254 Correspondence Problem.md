# Correspondence Problem
tags = #CV

Fundamental building block of Computer Vision


The task of finding a set of points which can be identified as the same points in another image.

There are two basic ways to find the correspondences between two images.

1. Correlation-based – checking if one location in one image looks/seems like another in another image.
2. Feature-based – finding features in the image and seeing if the layout of a subset of features is similar in the two images. To avoid the aperture problem a good feature should have local variation in two directions.
