It's pretty clear that you get sad and upset if you stop doing art for more than three weeks, but also every time you try and do some art, you are overcome with the sensation that it is useless and also what is the point if no one ever sees it.

Then you think maybe the problem is that nobody sees it so you try to be a content creator but the meaningless of it all sinks in or you get busy because you don't actually have a strong goal of being a content creator, you just like it when people see your art.

So what do you actually want out of your art?
You clearly like it. You made a frog wizard and it's the happiest you've been this month. 
You prefer making stupid stuff that is funny and brings joy over completing extended projects. In fact I don't think you've ever really completed a full extended project longer than a month or so. You also try so many different mediums. A dabbler.
