The most commonly used matching algorithm of point cloud is the Iterative Closest Point (ICP). However, in recent years, with the development of NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) algorithm, especially the emergence of three-dimensional NDT algorithm, the matching of point cloud can achieve higher speed and accuracy.

Compared with the matching algorithm such as ICP algorithm, the advantage of NDT algorithm is that **it does not need to establish a clear match between the feature points**. Especially during the moving of mobile robot, the scene sometimes changes and causes more wrong matching. The NDT algorithm is the mathematical analysis of the data to make the results more quickly and accurately. Matching time and the number of points is a linear relationship. And the growth rate is less than the ICP algorithm.
