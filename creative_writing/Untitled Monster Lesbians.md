Callista

- **Physical:**
    
    - **Appearance**: Dirty blonde, worn in a simple, low-maintenance style (perhaps always pulled back into a messy ponytail or braid). Her hair often looks wind-swept or unkempt from working outdoors or fighting.
    - **Height/Build**: 5'10", with a muscular, sturdy build for a woman. She’s all about practicality, with strong arms and legs built from manual labor and monster hunting.
    - **Body Shape**: Apple-shaped, carrying weight around her torso but with long, powerful legs that carry her across rugged terrain.
    - **Clothing**: Jenna’s wardrobe is functional—loose-fitting, durable nylon tops for ease of movement, cargo pants or jeans, and her signature cowboy boots, where she conceals knives. She also wears a vest with numerous pockets for tools, weapons, or items she might need on the go.
    - **Scars/Details**: Missing a pinky from a monster encounter, adding to her “tough” persona. Crooked teeth give her an approachable, rugged charm, though she sees them as just another imperfection in her otherwise hardened life.
    - **Tattoo**: A demon star tattoo on her sternum, likely a symbol of her survival or some dark experience with the supernatural world. No piercings—Jenna isn’t interested in anything that could get caught or ripped out in a fight.
    - **Age**: 25, though her tough life makes her seem older. She moves and acts like someone who’s seen too much and expects to see more.
- **Psychological**:
    
    - **Duty-bound**: Jenna feels an intense obligation to protect her small town, even though she herself feels like an outsider. This duty might stem from guilt, a sense of responsibility, or even because it’s all she knows how to do. While she’s not a hero in the traditional sense, she takes this role seriously.
    - **Isolationist/Mistrustful**: She’s deeply suspicious of anyone outside her town, seeing outsiders as a threat—both to her way of life and to the town she’s sworn to protect. This leads to immediate friction with Ingrid or anyone who doesn’t share her “crush first, ask questions later” attitude toward monsters.
    - **Hard-headed & Pragmatic**: Jenna’s not interested in magic or philosophical debates. She believes that monsters are inherently evil, and the best way to deal with them is to kill them before they cause harm. She has no patience for Ingrid’s idea of understanding supernatural creatures.
    - **Survivor’s mentality**: Jenna doesn’t expect to live a long life, given her line of work. This colors her worldview with a sense of fatalism—she fights because she doesn’t believe there’s any future for her outside of it. It also makes her reckless in some cases, unafraid of putting herself in danger.
    - **Outsider**: Though she protects the town, Jenna never truly feels part of it. People respect her, but no one really knows her. She’s fine with this on the surface, but deep down, it contributes to her inner loneliness.
- **Sociological**:
    
    - **Class**: Lower-middle-class, living off of what little money she can make from odd jobs, hunting, or rewards for monster kills. She doesn’t have wealth or a safety net, which makes her life even harder. Her home is likely small and run-down, yet functional—reflecting her no-nonsense attitude.
    - **Education**: Finished high school but never went to college. She’s street-smart and knowledgeable in practical survival skills and combat, but doesn’t have any formal higher education. This contrasts with Ingrid’s heavily tutored, academic upbringing.
    - **Religion**: Jenna is jaded about religion, believing that faith in a god is pointless when most people don’t even know the true horrors (i.e., monsters) that exist in the world. She’s not openly hostile to people’s beliefs, but she rolls her eyes at religious platitudes.
    - **Family**: Her adoptive father, who raised her and taught her everything she knows, is dead, buried in the backyard. He was likely a fellow monster hunter or someone who had experience with supernatural threats. Jenna’s entire sense of duty may have been inherited from him, which also means her approach is deeply personal.
    - **Relationships**: Jenna has no close family and few, if any, friends. While she is respected in the town for her work, she is too isolated and gruff to have close bonds. People might admire her bravery but also fear her intensity. She may have had a romantic relationship in the past, but it likely ended due to her line of work or inability to connect emotionally.

**Motivations/Conflict with Ingrid:**

- Jenna’s deep distrust of anyone outside her town will immediately put her at odds with Ingrid, who represents not just an outsider, but an intellectual, city-born way of thinking that Jenna finds infuriating.
- Jenna believes that monsters should be destroyed and that humans—though flawed—are the only beings worth saving. Ingrid’s more nuanced, understanding approach to monsters is antithetical to this. Jenna sees it as dangerous and foolish.
- Jenna’s method is brute force and survival, while Ingrid’s is precision, tradition, and method. This will create tension, especially when they’re forced to work together to solve a larger problem. Jenna sees Ingrid’s formality and rituals as a waste of time when the real solution is a sharp blade.

**Comparisons with Ingrid:**

- **Class**: Jenna’s lower-middle-class, rugged existence is the opposite of Ingrid’s upper-class, pampered lifestyle. Where Ingrid relies on refined magical techniques and resources, Jenna relies on her body, wits, and experience.
- **Education**: Jenna’s practical, hands-on experience contrasts Ingrid’s deeply academic, book-learned knowledge of magic and the supernatural.
- **Belief systems**: Jenna’s skepticism about religion and mysticism contrasts Ingrid’s deep belief in magic and the spiritual realm. Jenna’s perspective is rooted in a “what you see is what you get” mentality, while Ingrid believes in layers of reality beyond the physical.
- **Connection with the community**: Though respected, Jenna is alone. She doesn’t bond with the people she protects, feeling both above and apart from them. Ingrid, meanwhile, feels disconnected from everyone because of her awkwardness, but believes in a more collective, mystical connection to humanity through her heritage.

This fleshes Jenna out as a compelling, complex character whose practicality and survival instinct create an intense contrast to Ingrid’s intellectual, magical, and spiritual approach. Their personalities and backgrounds, though distinct, will clash in ways that drive the story forward and add depth to their relationship.
Ingrid

- **Physical:**
    
    - Tall and slender, with aristocratic features; 6'0"
    - Dark hair, almost black, worn in a sleek, controlled style (think chignon or braid)
    - Pale skin, possibly hinting at her sheltered upbringing
    - Wears sophisticated, tailored outfits, often in dark, muted colors like deep purples, blacks, or emerald greens
    - Carries a polished staff or an ancient family talisman, which she uses as a focus for her spells
    - Has multiple rings, each with a stone or symbol signifying her magical heritage
    - Eyes that are almost unnaturally vivid (a sign of her magical power), maybe bright green or violet
    - Late 20s or early 30s
- **Psychological:**
    
    - **Believes in her mission**: She is laser-focused on what she sees as the "proper" way to handle supernatural threats, considering Jenna’s brute force tactics to be reckless and barbaric.
    - **Faintly narcissistic**: Raised with the belief that her family is superior, not just because of their wealth but because of their magical lineage. She sees herself as part of an enlightened class.
    - **Rigid adherence to rules**: Her family’s spellbook and magical traditions are sacred to her, and she rarely deviates from the prescribed methods. This makes her resistant to improvisation or innovation.
    - **Spiritual connection**: She has a deeply mystical side, especially when it comes to communing with spirits, ancestors, and forces from other realms. This connection often takes her to realms beyond the understanding of most mortals.
    - **Socially awkward**: Because of her isolated upbringing, she struggles with normal human interactions, often coming off as cold, aloof, or condescending. This might be seen as arrogance, but it's often rooted in insecurity.
- **Sociological**:
    
    - **Class**: Born into an old-money family with deep connections to American history, possibly tracing back to colonial or Salem witch trials-era roots. Her family has a reputation for being mysterious but highly influential in occult circles.
    - **Ethnicity**: Ingrid's family could be of European descent, with possible ties to old-world magic traditions (e.g., Scandinavian, Germanic, or Celtic ancestry), adding an element of ancient mysticism to her character. This would also give you room to tie her magical practices to folklore and mythologies from these cultures, making her powers feel grounded in something deeply traditional.
    - **Religion**: A practicing pagan, but her spiritualism is steeped in her family’s specific magical traditions. She respects the natural world but sees it through a mystical, ceremonial lens—more focused on ritual than daily practice.
    - **Politics**: Ingrid sees herself as apolitical, but she inherently supports hierarchical, aristocratic structures. She believes that those with power and wisdom (like her family) should lead, while others should follow.
    - **Education**: Homeschooled by tutors in both traditional subjects and magical arts. She had little to no contact with the outside world during her upbringing, which further solidifies her awkwardness around regular people. She may have had some formal magical training at a prestigious, secretive school for witches.
    - **Family**: Ingrid’s family is large and influential within the magical community, with a strict matriarch or patriarch who oversees the family’s legacy. They are highly secretive, with strict rules about marrying within their class or magical community to keep the bloodline strong.
    - **Relationships**: Ingrid likely has strained relationships with others due to her upbringing. She may feel lonely but isn’t emotionally equipped to connect with people on a deeper level. She could have an arranged engagement or a complicated relationship with another magical family, adding personal stakes to her story.

**Motivations/Conflict with Jenna:**

- Ingrid’s adherence to "proper" methods of dealing with monsters and her rigid, by-the-book approach will clash with Jenna’s direct, no-nonsense style of protecting the town.
- Ingrid might believe that some monsters or supernatural entities can be reasoned with or understood, which directly conflicts with Jenna’s belief that monsters should be destroyed, no questions asked.
- Their differences could reflect the larger conflict between the city’s complex, bureaucratic approach to problems (represented by Ingrid) and the country’s simpler, more brutal methods (represented by Jenna).

This setup will help create a dynamic and believable tension between the two characters, each representing a different worldview, while also making Ingrid feel distinct and grounded in her own rich history.
