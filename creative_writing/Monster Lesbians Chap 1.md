A black sedan pulled into the parking of Simply Sweet Cafe, it's body low and sleek as it found a space between two pickup trucks occupying the small lot. The out of state plates marking it as an obvious tourist in this small town, but the expensive sedan not the usual car of a hiker passing through. 

The town's main street was a single road passing through near a national forest. The cafe was a plain low slung building with a fake stone facade, relatively recent compared to the tired general stores and restaurants that lined Main Street. 

The rumble of the expensive european engine cuts off. A woman gets out, dressed a grey collared top tucked into black pants. A silver pendant sways on her neck, matching her earrings, as she reaches back to pull her messenger bag from the passenger seat. She squeezes past the truck parked next to her, and walks into the cafe at a brisk clip, bag in hand.

The bell above the door jingles when she opens it,  and the diner smells of bacon and coffee. The woman wrinkles her nose slightly and she looks around, taking in the old timers at the bar and a crowd of early morning hikers fueling up for their trip, surrounded by eggs and toast. She frowned slightly. 

"Hi welcome in, take a seat anywhere" calls a rotund middle aged lady in an apron behind the counter.

"Ah, I'm not here to eat," she replies sharply, walking up to the counter. "I'm investigating some local fauna"

Ingrid did not like being in the boonies. Her cell service had been spotty for miles, and there had only been fast food at every turn off. How many Mcdonalds could one interstate hold? She considered putting her messenger bag on the counter, but images of greasy forks and napkins flashed through her mind, so she awkwardly opened messenger bag in midair instead. She pulled out a manila folder, and opened it to a printout of a satelliete image of the local area. She held out the folder in midair, above the imagined greasy counter, and tapped an area digitally circled in red. Inside the circle was nothing but nondescript woodland.

"Do you know if this area is accessible?"

The diner woman glanced at the sheet. "It seems you have the directions already, why dontcha just go there an look?" She started walking away to one of the bar patrons who was gesturing for more coffee.

Ingrid suppressed a spike of annoyance. She followed the woman on the opposite side of the counter, and stood behind the two older men receiving fresh coffee. "I /did/ go and look, but there's nothing up there. I can't get any closed than the paved road nearby. From my research it appears to be owned by a Zachariah Wells, but it's just trees."

A more emotionally astute woman would have noticed all three people in earshot stiffening at the sound of the name Zachariah Wells, but Ingrid was not that woman. She realized the woman was uncomfortable, but most people seemed uncomfortable about her and didn't even consider the sudden paleness of the woman's skin to be related to what she said.

"We don't know anything about a Zachariah," the diner woman replied brusquely. "It's maybe best you move along now."

Ingrid opened her mouth to protest, but the lady had turned away from her and put down the coffeepot with a bang. The grill cook next to her looked over in concern, but she shook her head and was suddenly very busy arranging the stacks of mugs next to the register.

Even Ingrid knew she was being dismissed. Her annoyance swelling, she walked out, the bell above the door chiming her exit. If she had bothered glancing back, she would have seen the diner lady and the old men with their heads together in a furtive, angry discussion. 


Ingrid stood by the on the shoulder of a two lane highway, one of many that wove up and down the mountains in the area. She had downloaded a map of the area to her phone the previous night at the inn, after a fruitless search the previous day. The blinking blue dot indicating where her phone was was the closest point she could get to the circled red area on her printed map on any road she could find.

She hated the outdoors. Her parents were indoor, mostly city folk. Most of her witch training was indoors, and frankly she hated the mandatory foraging classes in the Academy's grounds. She endured many apothecary gardening classes, but never took a shine to it much to her father's disappointment. And now this.

With a deep breath, she started crashing through the underbrush. The location on her map said the region was less than a mile away.

"Hey! Freeze! Hands up!"

Ingrid froze. The sound of her passage through the forest had been so loud she didn't hear anyone approaching. She felt a wash of shame as well. Her defense teacher would be dissapointed she failed to detect the intruder's aura, her attention held by trying not to get her shoes wet in the damp leaves.



"Get off my property" said the large woman.
