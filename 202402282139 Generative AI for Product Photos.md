**What problem are you going to solve?**
I am a small crafter on Etsy, and one of the worst parts of selling your artwork is taking product photos. The lighting is always wrong, it takes hours, you have to purchase props and cameras.  It significantly detracts from the joy of creation, and means many small sellers with great products are ignored because their pictures are not eye-catching. We can make it much easier for crafters to take consistent, high-quality product images. 

**How does your solution work? What are the main features? Please specify how you will use the AMD AI Hardware in your solution.**
Give an image of your product, we will remove the background, and use generative AI to produce a background that highlights the product. 



This requires the user defining the location of the product in the photo before the image is taken in by the system. 

TensorFlow for building and training models.
Mask R-CNN to automatically detect the product. 


So turns out this already exists, and is like pretty good.
