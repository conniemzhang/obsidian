## Cute Nails At Home
A lot of questions here ask how to look well-kept and neat, and a lot of answers say "have nice nails". I personally hate going to the nail salon, and there's a lot of at-home options now. I have been doing my nails at home for over a decade, and wrote up this comprehesive list of how you can have nice nails at home, and for your nail type.

## Nail Basics
Your nail is composed of three main parts: the cuticule, the nail bed, and the nail itself. The cuticule is at the base of your nail, and is the 
The nail bed is what holds your nail to the finger, and is crucial to the health of your nail
The nail itself is the keratin that grows out of your cuticule and turns into your nails. 
In order for your nails to look natural, it's best with any option to go for thin, multiple layers. 


## Prep
Prep is CRUCIAL. It is impossible to have nice nails with no prep, especially if this is your first time. It doesn't matter what nail manicure you use, it's gonna look like ass if you don't prep.
1. Push your cuticles back (or cut them, if they're very overgrown)
	1. Do not draw blood! This invites infections and weakens nails over time.
2. Use a cuticle oil 
3. Shape your nail
4. Apply the nail treatment of your choice (more below)

## Extensions at Home
If you are blessed with strong nails, I recommend just growing them out and using a color on top. For the girls like me with weak, peeling nails or blunt, square nail beds, there are two main options for at-home extensions:
1. Half-nail extensions
2. Full-nail extensions

Half-Nail Extensions - Natural Shade

Gel-X Extensions

Traditional Plastic Full Extensions

Half-Nail Extensions - White


## Troubleshooting your Nails:
1. My nails are weak and peel! I can't grow them long!
2. What shape looks best on me? 

4. I have sensory issues with my nails!
5. Long Nails = Good Nails?
6. 
7. Why the hell would you do your nails at home? Real Vindicta girls go to the salon. 
a. Not everyone has money to go to the salon, and gatekeeping is a gross look on everyone. 


Have fun!
