# Maximum Likelihood Estimation
tags = #Concept #Statistics 

> In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate.

> The goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to make inferences about the population that is most likely to have generated the sample
